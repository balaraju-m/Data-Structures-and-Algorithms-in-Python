Given an array Arr of size N, print second largest distinct element from an array.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the 
array is 35 and the second largest element
is 34.

Note :  If 2nd largest element doesn't exist then return -1.


Solution :

    1. Naive approach:

          The idea is to sort the array in descending order and then return the second element which is not equal to the largest element from the sorted array.
          
                                                    Complexity Analysis:

                                                                  Time Complexity: O(n log n). 
                                                                              The time required to sort the array is O(n log n).
                                                                              
                                                                  Auxiliary space: O(1). 
                                                                                As no extra space is required.
          
    2. Efficient approach :
    
                      Time Complexity: O(n). 
                          Only one traversal of the array is needed.
                          
                      Auxiliary space: O(1). 
                            As no extra space is required.

        print(" Invalid Input ")
        return
     
 
    first = second = -2147483648
    for i in range(arr_size):
     
        # If current element is
                # smaller than first
        # then update both
                # first and second
        if (arr[i] > first):
         
            second = first

        # If arr[i] is in
                # between first and
        # second then update second
        elif (arr[i] > second and arr[i] != first):
            second = arr[i]
     
    if (second == -2147483648):
        print("There is no second largest element")
    else:
        print("The second largest element is", second)
